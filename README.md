# Emacs Major Mode for EPICS

Author: Jernej Varlec

Version: 0.4.1

## Installation and use

Until a release on MELPA, you have to manually evaluate:
1. open *epics-mode.el* in emacs and run `M-x eval-buffer`.
2. opening a .dbd, .db or .template file will autoload epics-mode

You can modify settings by using Emacs customization interface (`M-x Customize`)
